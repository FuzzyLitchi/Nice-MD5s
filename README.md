# Nice-MD5s
Let's find nice patterns of MD5!!

This is totaly a nonsence but let's find nice patterns of MD5s.


## Definitions

A `nice pattern` considers as one of the below:
1. **Perfect match** - `00000000000000000000000000000000` etc.
   Example - not found yet...
  
2. **Nice match** - start with N-same letter - 
   Example of `N=4`:
   `md5('AGN04QP3DP74') = 444431252d6a104a05fe4a0c6a53a999`
   
   Example of `N=3`:
   `md5('CNFIVNSBBM86') = 555161f9f70ee828da527a6934596f61`
 
Please see the attached Python code to run on your computer, and post here if you find new one (credit promise!).

## Results:

**Perfect match** - N/A.

**Nice match** of 4 - Zvi Bazak.
